1. Overview
- The image shows a simple macroeconomics production diagram in a 2D coordinate system.
- Axes: horizontal axis k (Input: capital per worker) and vertical axis y (Output per worker).
- Two smooth, concave, increasing curves start at the origin. The upper curve is darker; the lower is lighter gray.
- Each curve is labeled near its right end: y = G(N′) f(k) for the upper and y = G(N) f(k) for the lower, with G(N′) > G(N).

2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies
- \documentclass: standalone (recommended for figures) or article.
- Required packages:
  - tikz (core drawing)
  - amsmath (math typesetting in labels)
  - xcolor (precise color control)
- Optional but handy:
  - mathptmx or newtxtext/newtxmath for Times-like look (if you prefer a Times-ish figure).

3. Layout & Canvas Settings
- Suggested canvas: square, about 9 cm × 9 cm.
- tikzpicture global options:
  - scale ≈ 0.9–1.0
  - line cap=round, line join=round for smooth joins
- Coordinate range:
  - x from 0 to ~9.5
  - y from 0 to ~7.5
- Use arrowed axes with fairly thick lines to match the figure’s visual weight.

4. Fonts & Colors
- Fonts:
  - Default Computer Modern is fine. If you prefer Times-like text: use newtxtext,newtxmath.
  - Math in italic (default LaTeX math italics) for y, k, G(N), f(k).
- Colors (suggested):
  - axiscol: black
  - upper curve: black
  - lower curve: gray!65 (a medium-light gray)
  - text: black
  Example definitions:
  - \colorlet{axiscol}{black}
  - \colorlet{curveUpper}{black}
  - \colorlet{curveLower}{gray!65}

5. Structure & Component Styles
- Axes:
  - Two lines with arrowheads: from (0,0) to (x_max,0) and to (0,y_max).
  - Thickness: very thick (≈ 1.2 pt) to stand out.
  - Axis endpoint labels: k at the end of x-axis, y at the end of y-axis.
  - Long axis captions: “Input (capital per worker)” centered below x-axis; “Output per worker” rotated 90° along the y-axis.
- Curves:
  - Both are smooth, concave, increasing from the origin. You can model them as A·k^α with 0 < α < 1.
  - Lower curve: lighter stroke (gray), thick.
  - Upper curve: black, thick; same shape but scaled up (higher A).
- Curve labels:
  - Placed near the right ends of the curves.
  - Upper: y = G(N′) f(k)
  - Lower: y = G(N) f(k)
  - Use above right/below right anchors to avoid overlaps.

6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Math content in labels:
  - y, k are italic math symbols: $y$, $k$.
  - G(N) and G(N′) with a prime: $G(N')$.
  - f(k): $f(k)$.
  - Full labels: $y = G(N')f(k)$ and $y = G(N)f(k)$.
- No special symbols beyond the prime and standard math letters.

7. Custom Macros & Commands
- Suggested TikZ styles and a reusable function:
  - axis/.style={->, very thick, color=axiscol}
  - curveU/.style={thick, color=curveUpper}
  - curveL/.style={thick, color=curveLower}
  - A declared function f(x) = x^α so you can scale it by G(N) values.

8. MWE (Minimum Working Example)
Copy, paste, and compile:

\documentclass[tikz,border=5pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{xcolor}

% Uncomment for a Times-like look:
% \usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}

\colorlet{axiscol}{black}
\colorlet{curveUpper}{black}
\colorlet{curveLower}{gray!65}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.95, line cap=round, line join=round]

  % Canvas limits
  \def\xmax{9.5}
  \def\ymax{7.5}

  % Function shape: diminishing returns (concave, increasing)
  % Adjust exponent (0<alpha<1) for curvature; scale factors for vertical position.
  \pgfmathdeclarefunction{f}{1}{\pgfmathparse{pow(max(#1,0),0.62)}}
  \def\GA{1.06} % upper curve scale = G(N')
  \def\GB{0.85} % lower curve scale = G(N)

  % Styles
  \tikzset{
    axis/.style={->, very thick, color=axiscol},
    curveU/.style={thick, color=curveUpper},
    curveL/.style={thick, color=curveLower}
  }

  % Axes
  \draw[axis] (0,0) -- (\xmax,0) node[below right=2pt] {$k$};
  \draw[axis] (0,0) -- (0,\ymax) node[above left=2pt] {$y$};

  % Axis captions
  \node[below] at (\xmax/2,-0.55) {Input (capital per worker)};
  \node[rotate=90] at (-0.75,\ymax/2) {Output per worker};

  % Curves
  \draw[curveU]
    plot[domain=0:\xmax-1, samples=220, smooth]
      (\x, {\GA * (f(\x))});
  \draw[curveL]
    plot[domain=0:\xmax-1, samples=220, smooth]
      (\x, {\GB * (f(\x))});

  % Labels for curves (adjust positions if needed)
  \path (\xmax-2, {\GA * f(\xmax-2)}) node[above right, scale=0.95] {$y = G(N')f(k)$};
  \path (\xmax-2, {\GB * f(\xmax-2)}) node[below right, scale=0.95] {$y = G(N)f(k)$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

9. Replication Checklist
- Axes:
  - Both axes start at the origin with arrowheads.
  - k at the end of x-axis; y at the end of y-axis.
  - Long labels: “Input (capital per worker)” below; “Output per worker” vertically along the y-axis.
- Curves:
  - Two concave, increasing curves from the origin.
  - Upper curve darker (black), lower curve lighter (gray).
  - No markers; lines are smooth and thick.
- Curve labels:
  - Upper labeled y = G(N′) f(k), lower labeled y = G(N) f(k).
  - Labels placed near the right ends; upper label sits above its curve, lower label below.

10. Risks & Alternatives
- Exact curvature: The original curve shape isn’t uniquely determined. If you want a closer match:
  - Adjust the exponent α in f(x) = x^α (e.g., 0.55–0.70).
  - Alternatively try f(x) = 1 - e^{-bx} (scaled), which is also concave and passes through the origin when multiplied by x (e.g., x(1 - e^{-bx})). Pick whichever visually matches best.
- Label placement can collide on different page sizes; tweak the node anchors and x-positions.
- Font differences: If your document uses Times or another font, enable newtxtext/newtxmath for closer typographic match.
- Color rendering may vary by viewer/printer; adjust gray percentage if the lower curve looks too light or too dark.
- If you prefer pgfplots for axes and data handling, you can replicate the figure using \begin{axis}[axis lines=middle, ...] and plot expressions; however, for this minimalist graphic, raw TikZ is lighter and compiles faster.
