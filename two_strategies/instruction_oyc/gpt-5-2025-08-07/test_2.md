1. Overview
- The figure is a clean, black-and-white TikZ diagram composed of several narrow vertical rectangles arranged in groups:
  - Left group: two parallel vertical bars (a “pair”).
  - Middle: two such pairs placed side by side (four bars total).
  - Right group: another pair.
- Curved connectors:
  - A large arch connects the outer left and outer right groups at the top.
  - A smaller arch connects the two middle pairs at the top.
- Oblique connectors:
  - A solid slanted line from the left pair toward the middle-left pair, labeled w1.
  - A dashed slanted line from the middle-right pair toward the right pair, also labeled w1.
- Labels beneath the groups:
  - The left and right pairs are labeled with the math text ˜w1 (i.e., $\tilde{w}_1$) and have a short double underline under each label.
  - Each of the two middle pairs is labeled ˜w2 (i.e., $\tilde{w}_2$), each with its own short double underline.

2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies
- \documentclass:
  - standalone (best for quickly compiling a single TikZ figure), or article.
- Required packages:
  - tikz
  - xcolor
  - amsmath
  - amssymb
- TikZ libraries:
  - calc (for simple coordinate arithmetic)

Example preamble:
- \documentclass[tikz,border=6pt]{standalone}
- \usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}
- \usepackage{xcolor}
- \usetikzlibrary{calc}

3. Layout & Canvas Settings
- Canvas size: approximately 11 cm wide by 5.5 cm tall after compilation (with default scale=1).
- Recommended global settings:
  - scale=1
  - line cap=round, line join=round for smooth corners and arch connections.
  - border=6pt in the standalone class to give comfortable whitespace around the figure.
- Internal geometric parameters (used in the MWE):
  - Bar width W ≈ 0.28
  - Bar height H ≈ 3.00
  - Gap inside each pair G ≈ 0.60
  - Pair centers at x ≈ 0 (left), 4.0 (middle-left), 5.6 (middle-right), 9.8 (right).

4. Fonts & Colors
- Colors:
  - The figure is monochrome. You can optionally define:
    - \colorlet{ink}{black}
  - All strokes and text use ink (black).
- Fonts:
  - Default Computer Modern is appropriate.
  - Math labels: $\tilde{w}_1$ and $\tilde{w}_2$, plus $w_1$ for the slanted-line annotations.
  - Font sizes: \normalsize for labels (fits well under each pair).

5. Structure & Component Styles
- Core components:
  - Vertical bars:
    - Shape: rectangles with no fill (transparent) and black outlines.
    - Dimensions: width ≈ 0.28, height ≈ 3.00.
    - Arranged in pairs with an internal gap ≈ 0.60.
    - Line width: about 0.7–0.9 pt (default TikZ draw line width is good; you can use draw line width=0.8pt).
  - Double underlines:
    - Two short horizontal segments under each pair, length ≈ 1.1–1.3 units, vertically offset by ~0.14 between them.
  - Curved arches:
    - Big arch over the left and right groups; smooth cubic Bézier curve with gentle sag.
    - Small arch connecting the two middle pairs; smaller curvature and span.
  - Oblique connectors:
    - Solid line from left pair to middle-left pair, labeled $w_1$.
    - Dashed line from middle-right pair to right pair, labeled $w_1$.
- Labels:
  - Centered under each pair: $\tilde{w}_1$ (left and right) and $\tilde{w}_2$ (each of the middle pairs).
  - Along oblique connectors: $w_1$, positioned with node[sloped, above,...].

6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Special math:
  - Tilde over symbols: $\tilde{w}_1$, $\tilde{w}_2$.
  - Subscripts: _1 and _2.
- Dashed line:
  - Use the TikZ option dashed.
- Smooth curves:
  - Cubic Bézier via .. controls (a,b) and (c,d) .. syntax.

7. Custom Macros & Commands
- To keep the code readable, define a small macro to draw a “pair” with underline and label:
  - \drawpair{(center)}{<math label>}{<half underline length>}
- Optionally centralize line aesthetics via a tikzpicture option:
  - [line cap=round, line join=round, scale=1]

8. MWE (Minimum Working Example)
- Copy-paste and compile this code to reproduce a diagram closely matching the original.

\documentclass[tikz,border=6pt]{standalone}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}
\usepackage{xcolor}
\usetikzlibrary{calc}

\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}[line cap=round, line join=round, scale=1]

% Global geometry parameters
\pgfmathsetmacro{\W}{0.28}   % bar width
\pgfmathsetmacro{\H}{3.00}   % bar height
\pgfmathsetmacro{\G}{0.60}   % gap inside a pair
\pgfmathsetmacro{\Gh}{0.5*\G}
\pgfmathsetmacro{\Wh}{0.5*\W}

% Pair centers
\coordinate (L)  at (0.0,0);
\coordinate (C1) at (4.0,0);
\coordinate (C2) at (5.6,0);
\coordinate (R)  at (9.8,0);

% Helper: draw one pair of posts with a double underline and a centered label
\newcommand{\drawpair}[3]{% #1 = center coordinate, #2 = math label, #3 = half underline length
  \begin{scope}[shift={(#1)}]
    % left and right posts
    \draw (-\Gh-\Wh,0) rectangle ++(\W,\H);
    \draw ( \Gh-\Wh,0) rectangle ++(\W,\H);
    % double underline
    \draw (-#3,-0.28) -- (#3,-0.28);
    \draw (-#3,-0.42) -- (#3,-0.42);
    % label
    \node[font=\normalsize] at (0,-0.75) {$#2$};
  \end{scope}
}

% Draw the four pairs
\drawpair{(L)}{\tilde{w}_1}{0.65}
\drawpair{(C1)}{\tilde{w}_2}{0.55}
\drawpair{(C2)}{\tilde{w}_2}{0.55}
\drawpair{(R)}{\tilde{w}_1}{0.65}

% Big arch from the outer left post to the outer right post
\draw ($(L)+(-\Gh-\Wh,\H)$)
   .. controls + (4,2.2) and + (-4,2.2) ..
   ($(R)+(\Gh+\Wh,\H)$);

% Small arch over the two middle pairs (from right post of C1 to left post of C2)
\draw ($(C1)+(\Gh+\Wh,\H)$)
   .. controls + (0.9,0.8) and + (-0.9,0.8) ..
   ($(C2)+(-\Gh-\Wh,\H)$);

% Oblique connectors with labels
\draw ($(L)+(\Gh,1.6)$) -- node[sloped, above left, pos=0.55] {$w_1$} ($(C1)+(-0.5,0.6)$);
\draw[dashed] ($(C2)+(0.4,2.2)$) -- node[sloped, above, pos=0.6] {$w_1$} ($(R)+(-0.6,1.5)$);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

9. Replication Checklist
- Pairs:
  - Left and right groups each show exactly two narrow, tall rectangles with similar spacing.
  - Center region shows two such pairs placed side by side (four bars).
- Labels:
  - Under left and right pairs: $\tilde{w}_1$.
  - Under each middle pair: $\tilde{w}_2$.
  - Each label has a short double underline directly beneath it.
- Connectors:
  - Big arch spanning from the outer-left post of the left pair to the outer-right post of the right pair.
  - Small arch between the two middle pairs.
  - Solid slanted line from left pair to middle-left pair, labeled $w_1$.
  - Dashed slanted line from middle-right pair to right pair, labeled $w_1$.
- Styles:
  - Monochrome black strokes, no fill.
  - Rounded joins/caps, medium stroke width.

10. Risks & Alternatives
- Exact geometry and spacing:
  - Small differences in post width, gap, and arch curvature can subtly change the look.
  - Solution: tweak \W, \H, \G and the Bézier control vectors until it visually matches your target image.
- Font differences:
  - If you compile with a different font setup than Computer Modern, label metrics may shift slightly.
  - Solution: stick to default fonts or set \usepackage{newtxmath} or other math fonts consistently.
- Output size:
  - If your figure seems too large/small, adjust the tikzpicture scale or the standalone class border.
- Coordinate arithmetic:
  - If you prefer not to use calc, replace $()$ coordinate math with precomputed numeric coordinates, or compute them with \pgfmathsetmacro and place explicitly.
- Alternative implementation:
  - You can factor pairs into a TikZ style or a \foreach loop if you need many; for absolute control, keep coordinates explicit as in the MWE.
