1. Overview
- The figure depicts a skewed rectangular plane (a red wireframe parallelogram) representing a subspace. A light-blue diagonal segment lies on the plane. Several marked points are shown:
  - A base point P̄ on the plane.
  - Two “lifted” points above the plane, P and P⁺, reached via curved black arrows from P̄.
  - Two on-plane targets: a red starred point PS,m near the blue line, and a right-hand point PR,m with a small right-angle tick next to it. A short arrow on the plane goes from PS,m to PR,m.
- Mathematical labels annotate the plane’s edges with calligraphic L-expressions, and the ambient space is labeled (L(X, E), D) above the plane.

2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies
- \documentclass: standalone (recommended for figures) or article.
- Required packages:
  - tikz
  - amsmath
  - amssymb
- TikZ libraries:
  - arrows.meta (modern arrowheads)
  - calc (coordinate calculations)
  - positioning (clean label placement)
  - decorations.markings (optional, for advanced arrow styling)

3. Layout & Canvas Settings
- Canvas: approximately a square figure of 8–9 cm.
- tikzpicture scale: 1.05–1.15 to make labels readable; the MWE uses scale=1.1.
- Global drawing hints:
  - Rounded joins/caps for smooth visuals: line cap=round, line join=round.
  - Arrowheads: Stealth with small size for a technical look.
  - Keep a small border in standalone to avoid cropping labels (e.g., border=5pt).

4. Fonts & Colors
- Colors (suggested):
  - planeRed: RGB (194, 46, 46)  → a slightly dark red for plane edges and red labels.
  - planeBlue: RGB (76, 140, 220) → light/medium blue for the plane’s diagonal and blue labels.
  - black: default for general text and arrows.
- Fonts:
  - Mathematical labels use standard LaTeX math italics (e.g., \mathcal, subscripts/superscripts).
  - Edge labels on the plane are colored (red on the front-left edge, blue on the front-right edge) in italic math.

5. Structure & Component Styles
- Plane:
  - Shape: skewed parallelogram (no fill), drawn in planeRed.
  - Edge thickness: ~0.7–0.9 pt.
- Blue diagonal:
  - A straight segment across the plane, thickness ~1.0–1.2 pt, color planeBlue.
- Points and marks:
  - P̄ (on plane): a black “+” symbol; label “\bar{P}”.
  - PS,m (on plane): a red star “\star”; label “P_{S,m}”.
  - PR,m (on plane, right side): a black “+”, with a small right-angle tick nearby; label “P_{R,m}”.
  - Lifted points above plane: two black “+” symbols labeled “P” and “P^{+}”.
- Arrows:
  - Two curved arrows from P̄ to the lifted points (black, Stealth heads).
  - One on-plane curved arrow from PS,m to PR,m (black, Stealth head).
- An ambient-space label above the plane: “(\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{E}), D)”.

6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Special symbols:
  - Calligraphic letters: \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{E}.
  - Tensor-like subscripts: \otimes_{i=1}^{q} R_i and \otimes_{i=1}^{n} S_i.
  - Overbar: \bar{P}.
  - Star mark: \star for PS,m.
  - Right-angle tick: drawn manually with two short orthogonal segments; alternatively place $\perp$ near PR,m.
  - Superscripts: P^{+}.
- Use math mode $...$ for all symbolic labels.

7. Custom Macros & Commands
- Suggested TikZ styles to streamline:
  - plane, blueedge for the plane and blue line.
  - arrow and curved for consistent arrowheads/weights.
  - plus and smallplus node styles for the “+” markers.
  - labelRed, labelBlue, mathlab for colored/italic labels.

8. MWE (Minimum Working Example)
- Copy-paste and compile as is.

9. Replication Checklist
- Plane is a red wireframe parallelogram with no fill.
- Light-blue segment crosses the plane diagonally.
- Left-front edge label (red): L with tensor product over R_i. Right-front edge label (blue): L with tensor product over S_i.
- On-plane marks:
  - P̄ as a small black “+” with its label.
  - PS,m as a red star with label placed slightly to the right.
  - PR,m as a black “+” with a tiny right-angle tick near it and its label on the right.
- One short on-plane arrow from PS,m to PR,m.
- Above-plane label: (L(X, E), D).
- Two lifted “+” points labeled P and P⁺; two distinct curved arrows from P̄ to each.
- Visual proportions roughly match: lifted points sit well above the plane; arrows are smooth.

10. Risks & Alternatives
- Exact color matching: If your document uses different color profiles, tune planeRed/planeBlue via RGB/HTML triplets or xcolor’s dvipsnames (e.g., BrickRed, RoyalBlue).
- Font differences: Calligraphic shapes vary with math packages; for a different calligraphic style, load mathalfa or e.g. \usepackage[cal=cm]{mathalfa}.
- Arrow curvature: Bézier control points determine arc heights. Adjust the controls in the two curved paths to raise/lower the “lift”.
- Right-angle tick size: The tiny L-shape may look small at different scales; increase its offsets (0.18 → 0.24, etc.) if needed.
- Page cropping: If labels clip, increase the standalone border or add \clip margin with a larger bounding box.
- If compiling in article, remove standalone and wrap tikzpicture in a figure environment; ensure \usepackage{tikz} and the same libraries are loaded.
