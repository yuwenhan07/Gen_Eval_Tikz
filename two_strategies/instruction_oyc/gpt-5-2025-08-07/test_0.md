1. Overview
- The image is a clean two-set Venn diagram inside a thin black rectangular frame.
- A centered title at the top reads “Borel, bounded functions.”
- Two large overlapping ellipses:
  - Left: light blue fill with a blue outline, caption “Eulerian sources.”
  - Right: light peach/salmon fill with a magenta/pink outline, caption “Lagrangian sources associated to a given χ.”
- The overlap has a lighter label “Broad sources.”
- A smaller, dark oval sits inside the intersection containing two bullet items “• § ??   • § ??” (the section sign § is visible).
- Colors rely on semi-transparent fills to create the mixed hue in the intersection.

2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies
- \documentclass:
  - Recommended: standalone for image-only output; article also works.
- Packages:
  - tikz
  - xcolor (with dvipsnames for extra named colors)
  - amsmath, amssymb (for math mode and the section sign/Greek letters)
- TikZ libraries:
  - calc
  - positioning
  - shapes.geometric (for easier ellipse node use, though we draw ellipses directly)

Example preamble lines:
- \documentclass[tikz,border=6pt]{standalone}
- \usepackage[dvipsnames]{xcolor}
- \usepackage{amsmath,amssymb}
- \usetikzlibrary{calc,positioning,shapes.geometric}

3. Layout & Canvas Settings
- Canvas size: roughly 12 cm × 7 cm fits the proportions and whitespace shown.
- Coordinate system: x=1 cm, y=1 cm for intuitive placement.
- Global styles:
  - Line width around 0.8–1.0 pt for frame and set outlines.
  - Fill opacity ≈ 0.7–0.75 for the two big sets to get a clear mixed color in the overlap.
  - A darker, nearly opaque core ellipse (opacity ≈ 0.95).

4. Fonts & Colors
- Fonts:
  - Default Computer Modern is fine.
  - Title: \normalsize
  - Labels and in-ellipse annotations: \small
  - Math: standard LaTeX math for χ and § (via \S).
- Suggested colors (using xcolor dvipsnames):
  - leftdraw = RoyalBlue (ellipse outline, left caption)
  - leftfill = RoyalBlue!18 (light blue fill)
  - rightdraw = Magenta (ellipse outline, right caption)
  - rightfill = Apricot!70 (peach/salmon fill)
  - corefill = MidnightBlue!85 (dark core ellipse)
  - overtext = RoyalBlue!60!black (subtle blue-gray for “Broad sources”)
  - Frame: black

5. Structure & Component Styles
- Outer frame:
  - Rectangle, 0.8 pt black line, no fill, around the whole canvas.
- Title:
  - Centered near the top inside the frame.
- Left ellipse (“Eulerian sources”):
  - Ellipse centered roughly at (4.15, 3.5), radii ≈ (4.2, 2.75).
  - Outline in RoyalBlue, 1 pt.
  - Fill RoyalBlue!18 with opacity ≈ 0.72.
  - Caption in RoyalBlue near the bottom just inside the frame.
- Right ellipse (“Lagrangian sources associated to a given χ”):
  - Ellipse centered roughly at (7.95, 3.6), radii ≈ (4.2, 2.75).
  - Outline in Magenta, 1 pt.
  - Fill Apricot!70 with opacity ≈ 0.72.
  - Caption in Magenta near the bottom.
- Overlap annotation:
  - Text “Broad sources” in a subdued blue (overtext) near the lower part of the overlap.
- Core (small dark oval):
  - Filled ellipse centered roughly at (6.15, 3.55), radii ≈ (2.0, 0.95).
  - Fill MidnightBlue!85, nearly opaque (≈0.95), no outline.
  - White text inside: “• § ??   • § ??”

6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Greek letter chi: use $\chi$.
- Section sign: \S (works in text or math; here shown in math for convenience: $\S$).
- Bullets:
  - Use $\bullet$ (math bullet) or \textbullet (text mode). In the MWE, $\bullet$ is used within math.

7. Custom Macros & Commands
- Suggested TikZ styles to keep the code concise:
  - venn/ellipse: base style for ellipse outlines.
  - leftzone, rightzone: reusable styles for the two big sets.
  - corezone: style for the small dark oval.
  - labelL, labelR, faint: text styles for captions and the overlap label.

Example:
- \tikzset{
    venn/ellipse/.style={line width=1pt},
    leftzone/.style={draw=leftdraw, fill=leftfill, fill opacity=0.72},
    rightzone/.style={draw=rightdraw, fill=rightfill, fill opacity=0.72},
    corezone/.style={fill=corefill, draw=none, fill opacity=0.95},
    title/.style={font=\normalsize},
    labelL/.style={text=leftdraw, font=\small},
    labelR/.style={text=rightdraw, font=\small},
    faint/.style={text=overtext, font=\small}
  }

9. Replication Checklist
- Is there a thin black rectangular frame around the figure?
- Title centered: “Borel, bounded functions.”
- Left ellipse: light blue fill with a blue outline; caption “Eulerian sources” in blue near the bottom.
- Right ellipse: light peach/salmon fill with a magenta outline; caption in magenta including χ.
- The two large ellipses overlap notably (roughly one ellipse radius worth of overlap).
- Overlap label “Broad sources” appears in a subdued blue-gray.
- A smaller dark ellipse sits within the overlap with two bullet entries “• § ??   • § ??” in white.
- Overall proportions resemble about 12 cm × 7 cm.

10. Risks & Alternatives
- Color matching:
  - Exact hues depend on your PDF viewer and printer. Adjust leftfill/rightfill and opacity values (e.g., 0.65–0.8) to fine-tune the overlap color.
- Fonts:
  - If you require a different typeface (e.g., serif/sans), add packages like newtxtext/newtxmath or mathpazo; recheck spacing afterwards.
- Opacity and blending:
  - Some workflows flatten transparencies; if your backend struggles, replace opacity with manually mixed colors (e.g., compute an intersection color and draw it separately via clipping).
- Layout portability:
  - If compiling in an article class, margins may clip the figure. Either use standalone (as in the MWE) or wrap the tikzpicture in a \begin{figure} environment and scale with \centering\resizebox{!}{...}{...}.
- Symbols:
  - The section sign is \S; ensure encoding doesn’t replace it. Using math mode ($\S$) is robust.
- Precise geometry:
  - If you need exact overlap proportions, consider computing intersection regions with pgf’s intersections library and filling them explicitly; the current approach leverages opacity for simplicity.
