1. Overview
- The figure shows six vertical ovals arranged left to right, each representing a copy of K_9 (a 9‑vertex set). Beneath each oval is a label “1K_9, 2K_9, …, 6K_9.” 
- Inside every oval are nine evenly spaced small nodes aligned vertically; some are filled (black), others are empty (white).
- A bundle of six smooth curves connects selected nodes from the first oval to nodes in the sixth oval, sweeping across the group.
- At the left is a y‑axis, and at the bottom is an x‑axis. Along the left margin are labels x_1 … x_9 aligned with the node levels, each with a small open marker. Along the bottom axis, six small open markers align with the ovals and are numbered 1 … 6.

2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies
- \documentclass: standalone (best for TikZ figures)
- Required packages:
  - tikz (core drawing)
  - xcolor (colors)
  - amsmath, amssymb (math symbols like K_9, x_i)
  - tikz libraries: calc, decorations.pathmorphing (general utility; optional but handy)

3. Layout & Canvas Settings
- Recommended page: standalone with border=3mm.
- tikzpicture baseline: use a centered coordinate system with ovals spanning about 9 units in x and 5 units in y.
- Suggested scale: 1.0 (vectors sized directly in cm-like units).
- Global styles:
  - Thin outline for ovals and markers (0.6 pt).
  - Axes slightly thicker (0.8 pt).
  - Nodes for points: radius ≈ 1.3–1.5 pt.

4. Fonts & Colors
- Colors:
  - ink: black (default)
  - axisgray: 80% black for axes (optional)
  - no additional colors are strictly necessary; filled nodes are black, empty nodes are white with black borders.
  - Example definitions:
    - \colorlet{ink}{black}
    - \colorlet{axisgray}{black!80}
- Fonts:
  - Default Computer Modern is fine.
  - Use math mode for K_9 and x_i.
  - Labels can be \scriptsize or \footnotesize; axis labels standard size.

5. Structure & Component Styles
- Axes:
  - y‑axis at x ≈ −2, from y ≈ −3 to y ≈ 3.
  - x‑axis at y ≈ −3, from x ≈ −2 to x ≈ 9.
- Ovals:
  - Six ellipses, equally spaced.
  - Each ellipse: x radius ≈ 0.60, y radius ≈ 2.30 (tall, narrow).
  - Centers at x = 0, 1.7, 3.4, 5.1, 6.8, 8.5 and y = 0.
- Interior nodes:
  - Nine per ellipse, vertically aligned.
  - y-levels from −2.0 to 2.0 with step 0.5 (9 levels).
  - Style “odot” for open nodes; “dot” for filled nodes.
  - A simple gradient of “filled count” per oval (more filled on the left, fewer on the right) closely matches the visual trend.
- Curves:
  - Six smooth Bézier curves drawn from selected nodes in the first oval to corresponding nodes in the sixth oval with gentle horizontal tangents; they sweep across all ovals.

6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Math symbols:
  - K_9 labels: use $1K_9,\dots,6K_9$.
  - Left labels: $x_1,\dots,x_9$.
- Small open markers can be actual drawn circles (preferred in TikZ) rather than the text symbol \circ, for consistent sizing and alignment.

7. Custom Macros & Commands
- Suggested TikZ styles:
  - dot: filled point
  - odot: open point
  - copyellipse: uniform ellipse outline
  - axis: axis lines
  - lbl: text labels
- A coordinate naming scheme v<i>-<j> for the j‑th node in the i‑th oval simplifies references and curve routing.

9. Replication Checklist
- Six tall, narrow ovals evenly spaced horizontally.
- Nine node levels equally spaced vertically in each oval.
- Left margin lists x_1 at the bottom up to x_9 at the top; each has an open marker aligned to the node levels.
- Bottom axis has six open markers aligned below the six ovals and numbers 1–6 below them.
- Labels “1K_9 … 6K_9” appear below the ovals (just above the x-axis).
- A bundle of six smooth curves sweeps from the first to the sixth oval, crossing gently.
- Filled nodes are more frequent in the left ovals and decrease toward the right.

10. Risks & Alternatives
- Exact color/weight matching: Line thickness and dot sizes may differ from the original; tweak line width and inner sep in the styles dot/odot to match your target.
- Spacing and proportions: If your output looks too compressed/wide, adjust DX (horizontal spacing), XR/YR (ellipse radii), and yfrom/ystep (vertical spacing).
- Curve shapes: The Bézier control offsets +(1.2,0.25) were tuned by eye. Increase the first component for a broader sweep or the second for more curvature; you can also give different controls per arc.
- Font differences: If you compile with non-Computer-Modern fonts, labels may shift slightly. Adjust anchor positions or use \scriptsize/\small as needed.
- Alternative construction: Instead of re-drawing filled nodes over open nodes, compute the style in one pass using \pgfmathtruncatemacro and a conditional; the overlay method is robust and easy to maintain.
