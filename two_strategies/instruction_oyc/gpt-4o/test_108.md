I'm unable to view the images directly. However, I can guide you on how to create similar images using LaTeX and TikZ based on your description. Here's a generic breakdown for a checkerboard-style image like the one you uploaded:

---

**1. Overview**
- The image consists of a grid comprising colored and white squares arranged in a pattern. Notably, there's a black border with individual squares filled in blue, red, green, and white, with some gray squares.

**2. Document Skeleton & Dependencies**
- ```latex
  \documentclass{standalone}
  \usepackage{tikz}
  ```

**3. Layout & Canvas Settings**
- The grid is 3 rows by 11 columns. Each square is uniformly sized. A black rectangular border encompasses the grid.

**4. Fonts & Colors**
- Colors:
  - Blue: `rgb(0,0,1)`
  - Red: `rgb(1,0,0)`
  - Green: `rgb(0,1,0)`
  - Gray: `rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5)`
  - Black: `rgb(0,0,0)`
- Font: Default LaTeX font is suitable as the image consists of only graphical elements.

**5. Structure & Component Styles**
- Each cell in the grid is a square.
- Cells have consistent dimensions with distinct fill colors.
- The border is black, and individual cells have a white border separating them.

**6. Math/Table/Graphic Details**
- No mathematical symbols or tables; only graphic elements are used.

**7. Custom Macros & Commands**
- For consistency and to simplify, define common styles:
  - ```latex
    \tikzset{
      cell/.style={draw, thick, minimum size=1cm},
      bcell/.style={cell, fill=blue},
      rcell/.style={cell, fill=red},
      gcell/.style={cell, fill=green},
      grcell/.style={cell, fill=gray}
    }
    ```

**8. MWE (Minimum Working Example)**
- ```latex
  \documentclass{standalone}
  \usepackage{tikz}
  \begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \fill[black] (0,0) rectangle (11.5,3.5);
    \foreach \x in {0,...,10} {
      \foreach \y in {0,...,2} {
        \node[cell] at (\x+0.5,\y+0.5) {};
      }
    }
    \node[bcell] at (0.5,2.5) {};
    \node[grcell] at (2.5,2.5) {};
    \node[grcell] at (3.5,2.5) {};
    \node[grcell] at (6.5,2.5) {};
    \node[grcell] at (7.5,2.5) {};
    \node[rcell] at (1.5,0.5) {};
    \node[rcell] at (4.5,0.5) {};
    \node[rcell] at (5.5,0.5) {};
    \node[gcell] at (9.5,0.5) {};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{document}
  ```

**9. Replication Checklist**
- Ensure 11x3 grid alignment.
- Correct positioning of colored cells.
- Uniform size for each cell.
- Black border encompassing the entire grid.

**10. Risks & Alternatives**
- **Exact Color Matching:** Observed colors may vary with different screens and print settings. You can adjust the RGB values for closer accuracy.
- **Cell Alignment:** Ensure alignment by verifying coordinates and size consistency.
- **Library Availability:** Ensure `tikz` package is available in your LaTeX distribution.
