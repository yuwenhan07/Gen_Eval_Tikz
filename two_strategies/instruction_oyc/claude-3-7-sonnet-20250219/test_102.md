# 1. Overview
The image shows a quantile plot with multiple lines representing different models: Factual, Target, and three Counterfactual approaches (MLPNet, SVM, RBFNet). The x-axis shows Quantiles (0-1) and the y-axis shows Cumulative Risk (0-1). The lines have different colors and follow different trajectories, with notable changes around the 0.6-0.8 quantile range.

# 3. Layout & Canvas Settings
```latex
\begin{tikzpicture}

# 4. Fonts & Colors
```latex
% Define colors
\definecolor{factual}{RGB}{0,0,0}        % Black
\definecolor{target}{RGB}{0,0,128}       % Dark blue
\definecolor{mlpnet}{RGB}{128,0,128}     % Purple
\definecolor{svm}{RGB}{0,128,0}          % Green
\definecolor{rbfnet}{RGB}{0,192,0}       % Light green
\definecolor{redline}{RGB}{255,0,0}      % Red (vertical line)
```

# 5. Structure & Component Styles
- Main plot area with axes and tick marks
- Five line plots with different colors
- One vertical red line at approximately x=0.6
- Legend with five entries positioned to the right of the plot

# 6. Math/Table/Graphic Details
- Superscript notation "a*" in the legend for "Target a*"
- Greek letter "œÅ" (rho) in the legend for the counterfactual models
- No special mathematical symbols beyond standard notation

# 7. Custom Macros & Commands
```latex
\pgfplotsset{
    every axis plot/.append style={line width=1pt},
    every axis/.append style={
        label style={font=\small},
        tick label style={font=\small}
    }

# 9. Replication Checklist
- [ ] Five distinct colored lines are present
- [ ] Vertical red dashed line appears at x=0.6
- [ ] Legend shows all five entries with correct symbols
- [ ] Axes labeled "Quantiles" (x) and "Cumulative Risk" (y)
- [ ] Plot ranges from 0 to 1 on both axes
- [ ] Legend positioned to the right of the plot

# 10. Risks & Alternatives
- Exact curve shapes may require fine-tuning of coordinates
- Font sizes might need adjustment based on document context
- Consider using `\pgfplotstableread` for data if available in tabular format
- For more precise color matching, use a color picker tool on the original image
- Consider using `groupplots` from `pgfplots` if this is part of a larger figure set
