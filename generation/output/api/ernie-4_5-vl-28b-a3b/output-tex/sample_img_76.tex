   \node at (7.5,-0.5) {26-6=20? Actually, 21-1=20 but 20 is used so 21- (6-1)= 21-5=16? Let's check: We have 26 at 11.5,1.5 and we need to get to 21 at 7.5,0.5. The labels are: 22,21,20,19,18,17,16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0.  For 26 to 21: 26(11.5,1.5) -> 25(10.5,1.5) -> 24(10.5,0.5) -> 23(9.5,0.5) -> 22(9.5,-0.5) -> 21(7.5,0.5). So yes, 21 is at (7.5,0.5).
