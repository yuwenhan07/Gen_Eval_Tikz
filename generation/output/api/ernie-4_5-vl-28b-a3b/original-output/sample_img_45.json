Remove all edges that intersect $L$, and vertices (other than $A$ and $B$) that intersect $L$ as well as their incident edges. What remains is a continuous image of a polygon with $L$ as a secant from one vertex to another. Triangulate this polygon with edges emanating only from $A$ and $B$.",

The first grid shows the original triangulation with a straight line `L` from point `A` to point `B`. The second grid shows the modified triangulation after cutting along `L`, with curved edges from `A` and `B` to nearby vertices to form the new triangulation. The points `A` and `B` are marked in red, and the line `L` is drawn in red thick.",
