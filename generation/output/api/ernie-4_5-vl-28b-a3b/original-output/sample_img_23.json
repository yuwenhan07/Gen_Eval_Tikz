The arrows are drawn between the nodes to show the directionality from left to right where possible, and looping back from \\(V_c\\) to \\(V_1\\).\n- The `foreach` loop is used to iterate over the sets \\(V_1\\) to \\(V_{c-1}\\) to draw the arrows between consecutive sets and the final loop back to \\(V_1\\).\n\nThis code ensures that the layout and relationships between the sets and arrows are consistent with the original image.",
