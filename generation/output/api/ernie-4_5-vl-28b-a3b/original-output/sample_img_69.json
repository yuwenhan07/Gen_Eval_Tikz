We present the result of our ablation study, where the performance of the adapted models is given by progressively enlarging the pretraining corpus size from 0.1 GB to 5 GB. Here, the zero and few-show accuracies were evaluated on the original ARC and TruthfulQA. The figure on the right illustrates the Mistral model's results on both Turkish and English versions of the ARC dataset, highlighting its improved performance in Turkish and decreasing performance in English with continued pretraining.",

  "raw_output": "The image is a line chart titled \"Comparison of ARC Scores of Mistral Model\". It illustrates the performance of the Mistral model on English and Turkish versions of the ARC dataset as the size of the pretraining corpus in Turkish tokens increases. The x-axis, labeled \"\\# of Turkish Tokens\", ranges from 0 to 2.5B tokens, while the y-axis, labeled \"English & Turkish ARC Acc.\", spans approximately from 30% to 63%.\n\nThe chart features two distinct lines representing different performance metrics:\n1. **ARC-eng Acc.** (English ARC Accuracy) is depicted with a red square marker line. This line shows a decreasing trend, starting at around 62% accuracy with 0 Turkish tokens and gradually declining to approximately 46% accuracy with 2.5B Turkish tokens.\n2. **ARC-tr Acc.** (Turkish ARC Accuracy) is represented with a blue circle marker line. This line shows an increasing trend, beginning at roughly 32% accuracy with 0 Turkish tokens and rising to about 40% accuracy with 2.5B Turkish tokens.\n\nThe legend clearly differentiates the two lines, aiding in the interpretation of the data. The visual representation highlights the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in the English performance, while the Turkish performance improves with increased pretraining in Turkish tokens. The chart effectively communicates how continued pretraining affects the model's performance on both languages, with the English scores deteriorating and the Turkish scores improving as the corpus size grows.\n\nThe LaTeX code to generate this chart using the pgfplots package is as follows:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{pgfplots}\n\\usepgfplotslibrary{groupplots}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n\\begin{groupplot}[\ngroup style={group size=1 by 1, horizontal sep=1cm},\nwidth=0.8\\textwidth,\nheight=0.5\\textwidth,\ntitle={Comparison of ARC Scores of Mistral Model},\nxlabel={\\# of Turkish Tokens},\nylabel={English \\& Turkish ARC Acc.},\nlegend style={at={(0.7,0.9)},anchor=north west,draw=none,fill=none},\nymin=30,ymax=63,\n]\n\n\\nextgroupplot[\nlegend columns=1,\nlegend to name=grouplegend,\nmark=square*,\ncolor=red,\n]\n\\addplot coordinates {(0,62) (50e6,56) (130e6,53) (250e6,52) (0.5e9,49.5) (1.1e9,48) (2.5e9,46)};\n\\addlegendentry{ARC-eng Acc.}\n\n\\addplot coordinates {(0,32) (50e6,33) (130e6,37) (250e6,36) (0.5e9,38) (1.1e9,39) (2.5e9,40)};\n\\addlegendentry{ARC-tr Acc.}\n\n\\end{groupplot}\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\ref{grouplegend}\n\\end{document}\n```",
