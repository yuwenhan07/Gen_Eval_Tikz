The blue rectangles are the first two layers of each successful blocking configuration: each contains a blue site in its activation region and is horizontally traversed by a blue line by the time it contains a red site. The closest vertical lines containing red points are at distance on the order $1/p$ from the $y$-axis, while the vertices of the cones are at distance on the order $1/\\sqrt p$ from the $x$-axis.",
