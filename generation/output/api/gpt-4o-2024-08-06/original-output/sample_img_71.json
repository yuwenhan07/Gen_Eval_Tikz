We select job $j$ at time $t=1$ which gives a value $v_j$, and causes the system to be busy for $S_j$ time units. Once free, we select job $j'$ from the set of available jobs and obtain (additional) value $v_{j'}$, and so on. %Figure above is only for illustration purpose where we sequentially choose item $j$, $j'$, and $j''$ to run as server becomes free during the process.",
