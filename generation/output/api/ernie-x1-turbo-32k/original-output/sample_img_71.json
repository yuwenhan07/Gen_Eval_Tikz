  "caption": "\\small The figure demonstrates a sample execution according to our model. We select job $j$ at time $t=1$ which gives a value $v_j$, and causes the system to be busy for $S_j$ time units. Once free, we select job $j'$ from the set of available jobs and obtain (additional) value $v_{j'}$, and so on. %Figure above is only for illustration purpose where we sequentially choose item $j$, $j'$, and $j''$ to run as server becomes free during the process.",

  "raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to generate a LaTeX/TikZ code that visually represents the sequential selection of jobs by a server as described. The server selects jobs at specific times, runs them for a certain duration, and then becomes free to select the next job. The goal is to accurately depict this process with appropriate labels and timing.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Timeline Setup**: Draw a horizontal timeline to represent the passage of time.\n2. **Busy Intervals**: Represent each job's execution period with a filled rectangle, labeled with the job identifier and its value.\n3. **Selection Points**: Mark the points in time when the server becomes free and selects the next job. Use arrows to indicate the transition from free to busy state.\n4. **Labels and Annotations**: Clearly label each job's execution interval and the times at which jobs are selected.\n\n### Solution Code\n```latex\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=3mm]{standalone}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.2cm, y=0.8cm]\n% Draw timeline\n\\draw[thick, ->] (0,0) -- (10,0) node[right] {Time};\n\\foreach \\t in {0,1,3,6,8.5}\n  \\draw (\\t,0) -- (\\t,-0.1) node[below] {\\t};\n\n% Busy periods (gray filled rectangles)\n\\draw[fill=gray!30] (1,0) rectangle node[above,midway,yshift=3pt] {Job $j$, $v_j$} (3,0.5);\n\\draw[fill=gray!30] (3,0) rectangle node[above,midway,yshift=3pt] {Job $j'$, $v_{j'}$} (6,0.5);\n\\draw[fill=gray!30] (6,0) rectangle node[above,midway,yshift=3pt] {Job $j''$, $v_{j''}$} (8.5,0.5);\n\n% Selection arrows and labels\n\\draw[->] (0,1) node[above,align=center] {Free\\\\(Initially)} -- (1,0.5);\n\\node at (1, -0.5) {Select $j$ at $t=1$};\n\n\\draw[->] (3,1) node[above,align=center] {Free\\\\($t=1+S_j$)} -- (3,0.5);\n\\node at (3, -0.5) {Select $j'$ at $t=1+S_j$};\n\n\\draw[->] (6,1) node[above,align=center] {Free\\\\($t=1+S_j+S_{j'}$)} -- (6,0.5);\n\\node at (6, -0.5) {Select $j''$ at $t=1+S_j+S_{j'}$};\n\n\\draw[->] (8.5,1) node[above,align=center] {Free\\\\($t=1+S_j+S_{j'}+S_{j''}$)} -- (8.5,0.5);\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Timeline**: The horizontal line represents time, with markers at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8.5 units.\n- **Busy Intervals**: Each job's execution period is shown as a gray-filled rectangle. The duration of each job (S_j, S_j', S_j'') is represented by the width of these rectangles.\n- **Selection Points**: Arrows from the \"Free\" labels to the start of each busy interval indicate when the server selects the next job. Each selection point is labeled with the time and the job selected.\n- **Annotations**: Below the timeline, each selection time is explicitly labeled to show the progression from one job to the next.\n\nThis approach ensures that the visual representation accurately reflects the sequential job selection and execution process described, with clear labels and timing annotations.",
