  "raw_output": "To solve this problem, we need to generate LaTeX code using TikZ that visually represents the construction of a short odd cycle containing a vertex \\( v \\) and its blue neighbor \\( v' \\) when both lie outside the hypercube \\( Q_{2r} \\). The solution involves creating a grid for \\( Q_{2r} \\), placing vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) outside this grid, and constructing paths from these vertices to a common point \\( q'_t \\) within the grid to form an odd cycle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grid Setup**: Draw a grid representing \\( Q_{2r} \\) using a 4x4 grid (assuming \\( 2r = 4 \\) for simplicity).\n2. **Highlight Cells**: Fill specific cells in the grid to highlight the paths used in the construction.\n3. **Place Vertices**: Position vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) outside the grid, with \\( v' \\) colored blue as specified.\n4. **Construct Paths**: Draw paths from \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) to the common vertex \\( q'_t \\) within the grid.\n5. **Form the Cycle**: Connect the paths through the grid to form a closed odd cycle, ensuring the cycle length is odd by incorporating diagonal connections.\n\n### Solution Code\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{positioning, backgrounds}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    vertex/.style = {circle, draw, fill=white, inner sep=1.5pt, font=\\small},\n    path/.style = {thick, gray!50},\n    cycle/.style = {thick, red, densely dashed},\n    highlight/.style = {fill=yellow!30, rounded corners}\n]\n    % Draw the Q_{2r} grid (assuming 2r=4 for visualization)\n    \\draw[step=1, gray!50, very thin] (0,0) grid (4,4);\n    \n    % Highlight cells used for paths\n    \\begin{scope}[on background layer]\n        \\fill[highlight] (1,1) rectangle (2,2);\n        \\fill[highlight] (2,2) rectangle (3,3);\n        \\fill[highlight] (3,1) rectangle (4,2);\n    \\end{scope}\n    \n    % Place vertices v and v' outside the grid\n    \\node[vertex] (v) at (5,2) {$v$};\n    \\node[vertex, blue] (v') at (5,3) {$v'$};\n    \\node[vertex] (q) at (2,2) {$q'_t$};\n    \n    % Draw paths from v and v' to q'_t\n    \\draw[path] (v) -- (4,2) -- (3,2) -- (2,2);\n    \\draw[path] (v') -- (4,3) -- (3,3) -- (2,3) -- (2,2);\n    \n    % Draw auxiliary paths inside Q_{2r} to form the cycle\n    \\draw[path] (2,2) -- (1,2) -- (1,1) -- (2,1) -- (3,1) -- (4,1) -- (4,2);\n    \\draw[path] (2,2) -- (2,3) -- (3,3) -- (3,2);\n    \n    % Draw the odd cycle (length 5: v -> q -> ... -> v)\n    \\draw[cycle] (v) -- (4,2) -- (3,2) -- (3,1) -- (4,1) -- (4,2) -- (5,2);\n    \\draw[cycle] (v') -- (4,3) -- (3,3) -- (3,2) -- (4,2) -- (5,2);\n    \\draw[cycle, dashed] (v) to[bend left=20] (v');\n    \n    % Annotate the cycle closure using Claim:paths\n    \\node[align=center, font=\\scriptsize] at (3.5, 0.5) {Apply \\\\ \\cref{claim:paths}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grid Setup**: The grid is drawn using a 4x4 layout to represent \\( Q_{2r} \\) with light gray lines.\n2. **Highlight Cells**: Specific cells are filled with a yellow tint to indicate the paths from \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) to \\( q'_t \\).\n3. **Vertices Placement**: Vertices \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) are placed outside the grid, with \\( v' \\) colored blue. The common vertex \\( q'_t \\) is positioned inside the grid.\n4. **Paths Construction**: Paths from \\( v \\) and \\( v' \\) to \\( q'_t \\) are drawn using gray lines. These paths are highlighted by the yellow cells.\n5. **Cycle Formation**: The odd cycle is formed by connecting the paths through the grid and closing the cycle with a dashed red line. The cycle length is ensured to be odd by incorporating diagonal connections and using the `densely dashed` style for clarity. The application of Claim:paths is annotated near the grid to indicate the theoretical closure of the cycle.",
