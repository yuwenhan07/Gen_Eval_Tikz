  "caption": "Protection of the origin from red occupation, as described in Lemma~\\ref{protection lemma}. Red is initially confined to the area shaded red. The blue rectangles are the first two layers of each successful blocking configuration: each contains a blue site in its activation region and is horizontally traversed by a blue line by the time it contains a red site. The closest vertical lines containing red points are at distance on the order $1/p$ from the $y$-axis, while the vertices of the cones are at distance on the order $1/\\sqrt p$ from the $x$-axis.",

  "raw_output": "To address the problem, we need to create a TikZ diagram that visually represents the protection of the origin from red occupation as described. The key elements include a shaded red area, two blue layers with activation regions, horizontal blue blocking lines, vertical red lines at \\(O(1/p)\\) distance from the y-axis, and cones with vertices at \\(O(1/\\sqrt{p})\\) from the x-axis.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Red Shaded Area**: Represent the initial confined red region near the origin using a shaded rectangle.\n2. **Blue Layers**: Draw two concentric blue rectangles (layers) around the origin. Each layer includes a dashed inner rectangle (activation region) and a blue dot at the center.\n3. **Horizontal Blocking Lines**: Add horizontal blue lines through each layer to indicate blocking mechanisms when red is detected.\n4. **Vertical Red Lines**: Draw vertical red lines at a distance proportional to \\(1/p\\) from the y-axis.\n5. **Cones**: Create cones (triangular regions) emanating from points on the x-axis at a distance proportional to \\(1/\\sqrt{p}\\).\n\n### Solution Code\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.8]\n    % Red shaded area (initial confinement)\n    \\fill[red!20] (-0.5, -0.5) rectangle (0.5, 0.5);\n    \n    % First blue layer\n    \\draw[blue, thick] (-1, -1) rectangle (1, 1);\n    \\draw[dashed, blue] (-0.8, -0.8) rectangle (0.8, 0.8);\n    \\fill[blue] (0,0) circle (2pt);\n    \\draw[blue, thick] (-1, 0) -- (1, 0); % Horizontal blocking line\n    \n    % Second blue layer\n    \\draw[blue, thick] (-2, -2) rectangle (2, 2);\n    \\draw[dashed, blue] (-1.8, -1.8) rectangle (1.8, 1.8);\n    \\fill[blue] (0,0) circle (2pt);\n    \\draw[blue, thick] (-2, 0) -- (2, 0); % Horizontal blocking line\n    \n    % Vertical red lines at O(1/p) from y-axis\n    \\draw[red, thick] (3, -2.5) -- (3, 2.5) node[above] {$x = O(1/p)$};\n    \\draw[red, thick] (-3, -2.5) -- (-3, 2.5) node[above] {$x = -O(1/p)$};\n    \n    % Cones with vertices at O(1/√p) from x-axis\n    \\draw[gray, thick] (1.5, 0) -- (2.5, 1) -- (2.5, -1) -- cycle;\n    \\draw[gray, thick] (-1.5, 0) -- (-2.5, 1) -- (-2.5, -1) -- cycle;\n    \\node at (1.5, 0) [below=5pt] {$O(1/\\sqrt{p})$};\n    \\node at (-1.5, 0) [below=5pt] {$-O(1/\\sqrt{p})$};\n    \n    % Axes for reference (optional)\n    \\draw[->, gray] (-4, 0) -- (4, 0) node[right] {$x$};\n    \\draw[->, gray] (0, -3) -- (0, 3) node[above] {$y$};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Red Shaded Area**: A rectangle near the origin filled with light red to indicate initial red confinement.\n- **Blue Layers**: Two concentric blue rectangles. Each has a dashed inner rectangle (activation region) and a central blue dot. Horizontal blue lines through these layers represent blocking mechanisms.\n- **Vertical Red Lines**: Red lines drawn at \\(x = \\pm 3\\) (representing \\(O(1/p)\\) distance) to show boundaries where red points are contained.\n- **Cones**: Gray cones emanating from points \\((\\pm 1.5, 0)\\) (representing \\(O(1/\\sqrt{p})\\) distance) on the x-axis, illustrating protected regions.\n- **Axes**: Optional gray axes for orientation, enhancing clarity without distracting from the main elements.\n\nThis approach ensures all described elements are visually represented with correct proportions and relationships, adhering to the problem's specifications.",
