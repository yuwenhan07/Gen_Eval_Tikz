Shows two saddle move configurations (original and mirror image)\n2. Uses color coding (blue for original, red dashed for mirror)\n3. Includes handle circles at critical points\n4. Has connecting arrows between corresponding elements\n5. Includes labels for both propositions\n6. Adds decorative braces to highlight key regions\n7. Contains explanatory text below the diagram\n\nThe visual elements demonstrate:\n- The saddle structure as a pair of intersecting curves\n- The mirror image relationship through vertical reflection\n- Preservation of topological structure under orientation reversal\n- Correspondence between elements in the original and mirrored configurations\n\nThe diagram is designed to be self-contained while referencing the specified propositions. The mirror image is created using a combination of coordinate transformation (vertical reflection) and dashed red lines to differentiate it from the original blue solid lines.",
