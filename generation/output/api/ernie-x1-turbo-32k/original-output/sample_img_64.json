Three doses of vaccination are assumed, the second and the third being administered 28 and 208 days after the first. The transmission rate is $\\beta$, recovery rate is $\\delta$, the rate of becoming susceptible after disease is $\\gamma$, the vaccination rates are $\\alpha_i$ for $i^{th}$ vaccination, calculated as a proportion of people who took the previous vaccine, and the rate of vaccination immunity wearing off from $i^{th}$ vaccination is $\\phi_i$.",

  "raw_output": "To generate the LaTeX/TikZ code for the SIRV Compartmental Model based on the description, we need to represent the compartments and transitions accurately. The model includes the following compartments: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Quarantined (U), Recovered (R), and Vaccinated with three doses (V1, V2, V3). The transitions between compartments are defined by specific rates.\n### Approach\n1. **Compartments**: Represent each compartment as a rectangle with labels.\n2. **Transitions**: Draw arrows between compartments to represent transitions, labeled with the corresponding rates.\n3. **Layout**: Arrange compartments in a logical flow:\n   - Top row: S, E, U, R (left to right).\n   - Below S: V1, V2, V3 (vertical column).\n4. **Rates**:\n   - Transmission: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) with rate \\( \\beta \\).\n   - Incubation: \\( E \\rightarrow U \\) (rate not specified, labeled as \\( \\sigma \\)).\n   - Recovery: \\( U \\rightarrow R \\) with rate \\( \\delta \\).\n   - Relapse: \\( U \\rightarrow S \\) with rate \\( \\gamma \\).\n   - Vaccination doses: \\( S \\rightarrow V1 \\) with rate \\( \\alpha_1 \\), \\( V1 \\rightarrow V2 \\) with rate \\( \\alpha_2 \\), \\( V2 \\rightarrow V3 \\) with rate \\( \\alpha_3 \\).\n   - Immunity waning: \\( V1 \\rightarrow S \\) with rate \\( \\phi_1 \\), \\( V2 \\rightarrow S \\) with rate \\( \\phi_2 \\), \\( V3 \\rightarrow S \\) with rate \\( \\phi_3 \\).\n### Solution Code\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\usetikzlibrary{arrows.meta, positioning, quotes}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    compartment/.style={draw, rectangle, minimum width=2cm, minimum height=1cm, align=center},\n    arrow/.style={-Stealth, thick},\n    every edge quotes/.style={auto=right, font=\\footnotesize},\n    node distance=1.5cm and 1.5cm\n]\n    % Compartments\n    \\node[compartment] (S) {Susceptible\\\\$S$};\n    \\node[compartment, right=of S] (E) {Exposed\\\\$E$};\n    \\node[compartment, right=of E] (U) {Quarantined\\\\$U$};\n    \\node[compartment, right=of U] (R) {Recovered\\\\$R$};\n    \n    \\node[compartment, below=of S] (V1) {Vaccinated\\\\(1st dose)\\\\$V_1$};\n    \\node[compartment, below=of V1] (V2) {Vaccinated\\\\(2nd dose)\\\\$V_2$};\n    \\node[compartment, below=of V2] (V3) {Vaccinated\\\\(3rd dose)\\\\$V_3$};\n    \n    % Transitions\n    \\draw[arrow] (S) edge[\"$\\beta U$\"] (E);\n    \\draw[arrow] (E) edge[\"$\\sigma$\"] (U);\n    \\draw[arrow] (U) edge[\"$\\delta$\"] (R);\n    \\draw[arrow] (U) edge[\"$\\gamma$\"] (S);\n    \n    \\draw[arrow] (S) edge[\"$\\alpha_1$\"] (V1);\n    \\draw[arrow] (V1) edge[\"$\\alpha_2$\"] (V2);\n    \\draw[arrow] (V2) edge[\"$\\alpha_3$\"] (V3);\n    \n    \\draw[arrow] (V1) edge[bend right, \"$\\phi_1$\"'] (S);\n    \\draw[arrow] (V2) edge[bend right, \"$\\phi_2$\"'] (S);\n    \\draw[arrow] (V3) edge[bend right, \"$\\phi_3$\"'] (S);\n    \n    % Annotations\n    \\node[above=0.5cm of S] {\\textbf{Disease Dynamics}};\n    \\node[above=0.5cm of V1] {\\textbf{Vaccination Doses}};\n    \\node[left=0.5cm of S, rotate=90, anchor=center] {\\textbf{Population}};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n```\n### Explanation\n- **Compartments**: Each compartment (S, E, U, R, V1, V2, V3) is represented as a rectangle with labels for clarity.\n- **Transitions**: Arrows between compartments indicate the flow of individuals, labeled with the corresponding rates (e.g., \\( \\beta \\), \\( \\delta \\), \\( \\alpha_i \\), \\( \\phi_i \\)).\n- **Layout**: The top row (S, E, U, R) represents disease progression, while the vertical column below S (V1, V2, V3) represents vaccination doses.\n- **Annotations**: Text labels are added to describe sections (Disease Dynamics, Vaccination Doses) and orient the diagram (Population).\nThis code produces a clear, visually consistent diagram matching the described SIRV model, with all elements accurately represented.",
