  "raw_output": "Based on the description provided, we will create a TikZ graph with nodes A, B, C, D, E arranged horizontally. The graph will include:\n- **Bold edges**: Directed edges between consecutive nodes (A→B, B→C, C→D, D→E), representing expected relationships between repeated measurements.\n- **Dotted edges**: Directed edges that go backward in time (B→A, C→B, D→C, E→D), which are implausible as they contradict the known time ordering.\n\nHere is the LaTeX/TikZ code:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass[tikz,border=3.14mm]{standalone}\n\\usetikzlibrary{positioning}\n\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}[\n    node distance=1.5cm,\n    every node/.style={circle, draw, minimum size=0.8cm, inner sep=0}\n]\n    % Nodes\n    \\node (A) {A};\n    \\node (B) [right=of A] {B};\n    \\node (C) [right=of B] {C};\n    \\node (D) [right=of C] {D};\n    \\node (E) [right=of D] {E};\n    \n    % Bold edges (expected, consecutive forward)\n    \\draw[thick, ->] (A) -- (B);\n    \\draw[thick, ->] (B) -- (C);\n    \\draw[thick, ->] (C) -- (D);\n    \\draw[thick, ->] (D) -- (E);\n    \n    % Dotted edges (implausible, backward)\n    \\draw[dotted, thick, ->] (B) -- (A);\n    \\draw[dotted, thick, ->] (C) -- (B);\n    \\draw[dotted, thick, ->] (D) -- (C);\n    \\draw[dotted, thick, ->] (E) -- (D);\n    \n    % Optional: Add labels for clarity\n    \\node[below=0.5cm of A, anchor=north] {Time 1};\n    \\node[below=0.5cm of B, anchor=north] {Time 2};\n    \\node[below=0.5cm of C, anchor=north] {Time 3};\n    \\node[below=0.5cm of D, anchor=north] {Time 4};\n    \\node[below=0.5cm of E, anchor=north] {Time 5};\n\\end{tikzpicture}\n\\end{document}\n```\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Nodes**: \n   - A, B, C, D, E arranged horizontally with equal spacing.\n   - Each node is labeled and styled as a circle.\n\n2. **Edges**:\n   - **Bold edges** (`thick, ->`): Represent expected directed edges between consecutive time points (A→B, B→C, C→D, D→E).\n   - **Dotted edges** (`dotted, thick, ->`): Represent implausible edges that contradict time ordering (B→A, C→B, D→C, E→D).\n\n3. **Time Labels**:\n   - Optional labels below each node indicating time points (Time 1 to Time 5) for clarity.\n\n### Output:\nWhen compiled, this code will produce a graph where:\n- Forward edges (A→B, B→C, etc.) are bold and expected.\n- Backward edges (B→A, C→B, etc.) are dotted and marked as implausible.\n- Nodes are labeled and aligned horizontally with time labels below them.\n\nThis matches the described visual structure and adheres to TikZ best practices for readability and maintainability.",
