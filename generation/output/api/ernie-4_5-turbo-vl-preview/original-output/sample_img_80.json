The `trees` library is specifically used for the tree layout.\n- **Node Styles**: All nodes are styled to be circles with a border and a minimum size.\n- **Tree Layout**: The `graph/tree layout` is used to automatically arrange the nodes in a tree structure.\n- **Level and Sibling Distances**: These distances control the spacing between nodes at different levels and siblings at the same level.\n- **Nodes and Children**: The root node `0` has two children `1` and `2`, each of which has two more children, and so on. The ellipsis (`$\\vdots$`) nodes are used to indicate the continuation of the tree structure.\n\nThis code will generate a binary tree diagram that visually matches the provided image.",
