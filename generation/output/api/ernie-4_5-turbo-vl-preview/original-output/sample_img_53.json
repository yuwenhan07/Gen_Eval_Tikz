The top plot shows the prior $R^2$ induced by the \\textcolor{arr2flatcolour}{ARR2 prior (blue)} with our suggested hyperparameters for the \\(R^2\\) prior, \\textcolor{minnesotacolour}{Minnesota-type prior (yellow)}, \\textcolor{gaussiancolour}{independent Gaussian priors (green)}, and the \\textcolor{rhscolour}{regularised horseshoe prior (purple)}. The bottom plots show the prior means of the relative contributions to the $R^2$ of the regression coefficients. Here the different hyperparameter settings for the ARR2 are shown. \\textcolor{arr2flatcolour}{flat (blue)}, \\textcolor{arr2minncolour}{Minnesota-type (red)}, \\textcolor{arr2bumpcolour}{Bump (light blue)}.",
