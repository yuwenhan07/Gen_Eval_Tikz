The `intersections` library is included for potential use in calculating intersection points, though it is commented out in this example.\n\n2. **Axes**: The axes are drawn using `\\draw[->]` to indicate arrows. Labels are added using `node[right]` and `node[above]`.\n\n3. **Production Functions**:\n   - The original production function is drawn with `\\draw[name path=original]` and a `.. controls ..` statement to give it a curved shape.\n   - The new production function, representing the shift due to an increase in the size of the city, is drawn similarly with `\\draw[name path=new]`.\n\n4. **Labels**: The equations for the production functions are added as nodes to the right of each curve.\n\n5. **Intersection Points**: The code for intersections is commented out but can be useful if you need to find and mark the intersection points of the two curves.\n\nThis code will produce a graph similar to the provided image, illustrating the shift in the production function due to an increase in the size of a city.",
