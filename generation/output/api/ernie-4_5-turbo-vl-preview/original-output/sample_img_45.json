  "caption": "Cutting $F_{\\pi}$ along $L$: Let $A, B$ be the points where $L$ intersects the boundary of the surface. A subdivision of a given triangulation will have $A$ and $B$ as vertices. Remove all edges that intersect $L$, and vertices (other than $A$ and $B$) that intersect $L$ as well as their incident edges. What remains is a continuous image of a polygon with $L$ as a secant from one vertex to another. Triangulate this polygon with edges emanating only from $A$ and $B$.",
