Point `G` (or `H`) is at `(Îµ, 0)`.\n- **Lines**: Solid lines are used for the outer triangles, and dashed lines for the inner connections and vertical line.\n- **Labels**: Points are labeled with numbers, and the inner point `G` is also labeled.\n- **Distances**: You can label the lines as `C_1`, `C_2`, and `C_3` if needed, though their exact placement might need tweaking.\n\nThis setup ensures the diagram matches the visual layout of the original image, with accurate geometric relationships and labels.",
