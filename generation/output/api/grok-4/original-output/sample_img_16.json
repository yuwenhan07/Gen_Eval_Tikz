  "caption": "An example of our lower bound construction in Theorem~\\ref{thm:0/1_valued_1_query_lower_bound} where $m = 18$. Hence, we set $t=4$ and $n=t^2=16$ resulting in the profile $P$ shown above. In every agent's ranking (horizontal bars), the example mentions the top-ranked alternative. Additionally, we marked alternatives $11$ and $12$ in every ranking in order to showcase the symmetry of $P$. Alternatives $17$ and $18$ are shown for two agents of every cohort. Notice that these alternatives appear in the exact same positions of every agent's ranking.",
