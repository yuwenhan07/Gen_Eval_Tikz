Right: A sample configuration of the colored stochastic six-vertex model with $N=2$ and the packed boundary condition, i.e., $\\sigma(k) = k$ for $k\\in\\intint{-N,N}$. The numbers on the left boundary next to an arrow is the color of the arrow. Any edges without arrows should be interpreted as an arrow with color $-\\infty$, i.e., a color lower than the colors of all the other arrows in the system.",
