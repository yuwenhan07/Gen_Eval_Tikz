The minimum index so far is $\\gamma_i^{(\\ell)}$ and the minimum yet to come (including the final value) is the capped value $\\kappa_i^{(\\ell)}$. Yellow regions represent possible opportunities for exposure: if the index $\\sigma_i^{(\\ell)}$ of the next box under consideration is higher than the current $\\gamma_i^{(\\ell-1)}$, it is possible that $\\kappa_i^{(\\ell)}> \\gamma_i^{(\\ell - 1)}$, in which case failing to continue opening would cause exposure.",
