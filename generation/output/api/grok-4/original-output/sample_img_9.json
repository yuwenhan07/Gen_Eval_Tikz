  "caption": "An example workflow of how parallelism will work with our proposed method. We look to reconstruct to full-resolution images in parallel, achieved by sharing the deconvolved residuals across different nodes after each major cycle, denoted as MC in the figure. A low and high-resolution image are produced after the first major cycle, denoted as $i_{\\mathcal{L}_1}$ and $i_{\\mathcal{H}_1}$ respectively. Afterwards, full-resolution images $i_{{\\text{V}_\\mathcal{L}}_n}$ and $i_{{\\text{V}_\\mathcal{H}}_n}$ are produced. The final reconstructed images of their respective nodes, $\\hat{\\imath}_{\\text{V}_\\mathcal{L}}$ and $\\hat{\\imath}_{\\text{V}_\\mathcal{H}}$, are then combined to produce the final reconstructed image $\\hat{\\imath}$.",
