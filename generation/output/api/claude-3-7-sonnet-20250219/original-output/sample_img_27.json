  "caption": "Two antipodal observers follow the antipodal trajectories defined by the left and right edge of the diagram. The diagonal lines form the cosmological horizons $H_{\\rm L}$ and $H_{\\rm R}$ for the two observers. They bound the two static patches $P_{\\rm L}$ and $P_{\\rm R}$ depicted in blue. The dashed line is an arbitrary global spacelike slice one which we place a sphere $A$ depicted by a black dot. $\\Sigma_A\\in\\Sigma$ is the red segment and the future lightsheet emanating from $A$ is the dotted line. .",
