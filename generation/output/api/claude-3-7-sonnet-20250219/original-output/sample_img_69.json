We present the result of our ablation study, where the performance of the adapted models is given by progressively enlarging the pretraining corpus size from 0.1 GB to 5 GB. Here, the zero and few-show accuracies were evaluated on the original ARC and TruthfulQA. The figure on the right illustrates the Mistral model's results on both Turkish and English versions of the ARC dataset, highlighting its improved performance in Turkish and decreasing performance in English with continued pretraining.",

The graph illustrates the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, where as the model is trained on more Turkish tokens (x-axis), its performance on Turkish ARC improves (blue line going up) while its performance on English ARC decreases (red line going down).\n\nKey features of the implementation:\n- Proper color coding (blue for Turkish, red for English)\n- Correct data point markers (circles for Turkish, squares for English)\n- Appropriate axis labels and title\n- Dashed grid lines matching the original\n- Legend positioned in the bottom right corner\n- X-axis showing token counts from 0 to 2.5B\n\nThe graph clearly demonstrates the trade-off between performance on the original language (English) and the new language (Turkish) during continued pretraining.",
