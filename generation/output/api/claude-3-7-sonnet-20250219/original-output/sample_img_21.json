The key features include:\n\n1. The horizontal axis representing |v| with labeled points at 2, 4, 2^(3/2), 2^(5/3), 2^2, and 4^(3/2)\n2. The vertical axis with values 0 and 1 marked\n3. The magenta function η that:\n   - Equals 1 from 0 to 2\n   - Decreases linearly from 1 to 0 between 2 and 4\n   - Equals 0 for |v| ≥ 4\n4. The teal function η̃ that:\n   - Equals 0 from 0 to 2^(5/3)\n   - Increases linearly from 0 to 1 between 2^(5/3) and 2^2\n   - Equals 1 for |v| ≥ 2^2\n5. Dashed vertical lines at the transition points\n\nThe functions are properly labeled and the graph maintains the proportions shown in the original image.",
