Each diagram consists of:\n\n1. A triangle formed by fermion lines with arrows indicating the direction\n2. A wavy line (gluon) connecting to one vertex of the triangle\n3. Appropriate labels for the currents:\n   - $j_N^\\mu(x)$ for the gluon current\n   - $J_5^{\\nu}(y)$ and $J_5^{\\rho}(z)$ for the axial currents\n\nThe diagrams illustrate how the axial anomaly leads to non-conservation of the singlet flavor current $j_0^\\mu$, which is sourced by the dark gluons as mentioned in your description.",
