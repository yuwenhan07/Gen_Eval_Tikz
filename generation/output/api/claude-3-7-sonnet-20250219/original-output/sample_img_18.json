The numbers in the circles show the identification of sectors given by Legendre transform. The green numbers show the numbering of the strands, given by choosing a numbering near a basepoint $\\widehat{b}$ and continuing it compatibly in clockwise direction. The matrices are the partial formal monodromies given by the transformation rule (they come from the formal monodromies on the left, but change signs whenever one transits from a positive to a negative strand).",
