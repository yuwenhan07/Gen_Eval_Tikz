This game is not a conflict placement game because the top edge cannot be cut if both bottom edges are cut, but the top edge can be cut if at most one of the bottom edges is cut.",

It uses thick lines and nodes to represent the connections, with colors matching those in the image: the top and left edges are blue, and the right edge is red. The ground is represented by a thick black line. The nodes are drawn as small circles with white fill to match the appearance in the image.",
