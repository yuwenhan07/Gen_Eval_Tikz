  "caption": "Protection of the origin from red occupation, as described in Lemma~\\ref{protection lemma}. Red is initially confined to the area shaded red. The blue rectangles are the first two layers of each successful blocking configuration: each contains a blue site in its activation region and is horizontally traversed by a blue line by the time it contains a red site. The closest vertical lines containing red points are at distance on the order $1/p$ from the $y$-axis, while the vertices of the cones are at distance on the order $1/\\sqrt p$ from the $x$-axis.",

They are represented as small rectangles with a `blue` color.\n- **Grid Structure:** The overall symmetry and placement are aligned to create a coherent layout as described.\n\nCompile this code with a LaTeX editor that supports TikZ to visualize the output.
