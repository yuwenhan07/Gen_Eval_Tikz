  "prompt": "% \\daniele{I find the relation between the two paradigms a bit confusing, because I would naturally think at the data as a set of examples and at the weights as the student patterns. I understand this is done to link our regimes to the feature vs paradigms learning regimes of Krotov but it sounds a bit weird: for example the generation of the examples and the learning of the weights are two different processes, how can we connect them?} The first row of this diagram sketches how a $p$-body Hopfield network in the teacher-student setting can reconstruct an incomplete pattern $\\xi^b$ to match the teacher pattern $\\xi^*$ by relying on the examples $\\sigma$ obtained from $\\xi^*$. The second row summarizes how a dense neural network trained by Krotov can recover the labels $y'$ of the data $x$ given the weights $w$ learned from $x$ \\cite{krotov2016dense}. Both models tackle similar tasks using an approach where $\\sigma$ and $\\xi^b$ respectively play the same roles as $w$ and $(x, y')$. % Both models tackle similar tasks using similar approaches where $\\xi^*$, $\\sigma$ and $\\xi^b$ respectively play the same roles as $(x, y)$, $w$ and $(x, y')$. % However, the algorithm generating $\\sigma$ and $\\xi^b$ is different from the one producing $w$ and $y'$. The forward propagation algorithm used to generate $y'$ is similar to the update rule of the student (see \\cite{krotov2016dense} and Appendix \\ref{app:hamiltonians}), but the backpropagation algorithm used to learn $w$ is very different from the update rule of the teacher. % There is another interpretation of the teacher-student problem where $\\sigma$ and $\\xi^b$ are respectively analogous to the data $x$ and weights $w$.",
