  "prompt": "Illustration of the species coupling in case of a coinciding interface. In the figure, the dashed interface lies on top of the edge between two cells. It is assumed that $K_{j}$ in Equation~\\ref{eq:coinFrac} is the cell with the lower index and owns the coinciding interface. The affected edge $\\partial K_i \\cap \\partial K_j$ belongs to the species $\\mathfrak{A}$ and takes care of the coupling between cells $K_{i,\\mathfrak{A}}$ and $K_{j,\\mathfrak{A}}$. The species are then coupled inside $K_{j}$ via the interface, from the empty cell $K_{j,\\mathfrak{A}} = \\emptyset$ to the full cell $K_{j,\\mathfrak{B}} = K_{j}$. Finally, by performing the agglomeration, the discrete system is algebraically modified. This modification eliminates the (edge) contributions on $\\partial K_{j,\\mathfrak{A}}$ of the empty cell and combines the cell and species coupling, establishing the connection between $K_{i,\\mathfrak{A}}$ and $K_{j,\\mathfrak{B}}$. The lower part of the figure shows an exploded view of the situation to clarify the connectivity.",
