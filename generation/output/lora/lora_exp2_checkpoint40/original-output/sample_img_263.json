  "prompt": "The solid lines in the figure shows one of the non-symmetric spaces, with $N=3, L_*=4$ constructed in the fashion of Example \\ref{ex:nonsym}, together with the ordering of vertices described. The dashed line indicates an edge, which can be added to produce another conductively uniform oriented replacement rule with the $L_*$-uniform scaling property, where the dashed edge is removable in the sense of Definition \\ref{def:removable}. In general, any edge which connects vertically aligned points is removable.",
