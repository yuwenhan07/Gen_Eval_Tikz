  "prompt": "Three ways in which the volume of the unbounded component restricted to a cube can change: in case (i) the topology within the cube changes and we bound $\\lvert\\Delta_v(B_w)\\rvert$ by $1$. In case (ii) there is no topological change in $B_w$ or in any cube which is connected to $B_w$ by a finite excursion component so we bound $\\lvert\\Delta_v(B_w)\\rvert$ by the volume of the solid grey region in the figure. In case (iii) there is a topological change outside $B_w$ affecting which components inside $B_w$ are part of the unbounded component, so we bound $\\lvert\\Delta_v(B_w)\\rvert$ by $1$.",
