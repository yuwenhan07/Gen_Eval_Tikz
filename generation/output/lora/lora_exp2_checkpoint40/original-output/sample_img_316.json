  "prompt": "Examples of singular free boundary points where the function $u-\\psi$ has strict quadratic growth. We expect quadratic growth in the direction of the \\textcolor{red}{red} arrows. The case on the right is more degenerate than the case on the left, and worse for the approximation of the free boundary $\\Gamma$ (depicted in \\textcolor{blue}{blue}). In both cases we have that $\\dim \\ker\\bfA = 1$. A discrete free boundary $\\Gamma_\\Triang$, which is at a distance $\\calO(\\delta(h)^{1/2})$ is depicted in \\textcolor{brown}{dashed brown}.",
